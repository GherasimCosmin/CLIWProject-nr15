    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the I-Fractr website is to offer an easier way of understanding and playing with fractals. The project itself is supposed to allow students and professors alike to experiment and see the practical implications of their theoretical studies.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The beauty of I-Fractr comes from it's verastility. While using it, you can choose between multiple ways of creating fractals.
      Some of these ways include going through an old-school fractal generator, displaying the result on a huge canvas,
      choosing to see and modify some of our most dear fractals - or even simply choosing a randomize option, with the resulting fractal's quality varying wildly.
      Our favorite ways of creating fractals though is by using the mouse feature available on desktop - if you drag anywhere on the canvas, the fractal changes automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also save fractals in different formats, upload them on the go or simply let the website retain your work so that you can continue it at a later time.

      <h3>The <code>landing page</code></h3>
      <p>
        The landing page is a simple login page - giving the user the options to either login or sign up. After login in, a menu will appear -
        showing all the options a user has when using our website: Creating a new fractal, Continuing his previous work, Download fractals as PNG/SVG or simply, loging out.
      </p>
      <section id="New">
          <h3>The <code>New Page</code></h3>
          <p>
            The "New" section of our website is where the magic happens when it comes to creating fractals. The user is shown a canvas and three options: to either choose a
            fractal from our best-of list (upon clicking one, it appears in the canvas & the user can modify it in the "Generate" tab.
            The "Generate" tab is meant for our hardcore userbase - those that want to use hardcore mathematics to create perfect fractals. Upon clicking the "Generate" button,
            their respective fractal is build in the canvas.
            Lastly, the "Random" tab is an experimental feature and meant to be treated as a little fun functionality. But even then, you may be surprised at what it can deliver. Be sure to try1
            Also, here the user can save his work on our database by clicking the "Save" button.

        <section id="Continue">
          <h3>The <code>Continue Page</code></h3>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, when creating fractals the user is given the option of saving them on our servers.
            If one chooses to do so, when one logs in at a later date their work is ready and waiting for them, in the "Continue" tab.
            By clicking on one fractal, the user is sent to the "New" tab with all the fields completed with the necessary information.

        <section id="Download">
          <h3>The <code>Download Page</code></h3>
          <p>
            Whenever a uses may want to share his work, or simply take his work offline, he's given the option to use our "Download" page.
            Here he can choose which fractals to download, in which formats, and whether if he wants to download them all in bulk or one by one.

            When the work is done, there's no reason to hang a around. This is the hero's exit.
