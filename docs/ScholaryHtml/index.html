		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of the I-Fractr website is to offer an easier way of understanding and playing with fractals. The project itself is supposed to allow students and professors alike to experiment and see the practical implications of their theoretical studies.
		</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The beauty of I-Fractr comes from it's verastility. While using it, you can choose between multiple ways of creating fractals.
			Some of these ways include going through an old-school fractal generator, displaying the result on a huge canvas,
			choosing to see and modify some of our most dear fractals - or even simply choosing a randomize option, with the resulting fractal's quality varying wildly.
			Our favorite ways of creating fractals though is by using the mouse feature available on desktop - if you drag anywhere on the canvas, the fractal changes automatically!
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also save fractals in different formats, upload them on the go or simply let the website retain your work so that you can continue it at a later time.

		<h2>Structure</h2>
		<p>

		</p>
		<section id="LandingPage">
			<h3>The <code>landing page</code></h3>
			<p>
				The landing page is a simple login page - giving the user the options to either login or sign up. After login in, a menu will appear -
				showing all the options a user has when using our website: Creating a new fractal, Continuing his previous work, Download fractals as PNG/SVG or simply, loging out.
			</p>
			<section id="New">
				<h3>The <code>New Page</code></h3>
				<p>
					The "New" section of our website is where the magic happens when it comes to creating fractals. The user is shown a canvas and three options: to either choose a
					fractal from our best-of list (upon clicking one, it appears in the canvas & the user can modify it in the "Generate" tab.
					The "Generate" tab is meant for our hardcore userbase - those that want to use hardcore mathematics to create perfect fractals. Upon clicking the "Generate" button,
					their respective fractal is build in the canvas.
					Lastly, the "Random" tab is an experimental feature and meant to be treated as a little fun functionality. But even then, you may be surprised at what it can deliver. Be sure to try1
					Also, here the user can save his work on our database by clicking the "Save" button.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="Continue">
				<h3>The <code>Continue Page</code></h3>
				<p>
					As mentioned above, when creating fractals the user is given the option of saving them on our servers.
					If one chooses to do so, when one logs in at a later date their work is ready and waiting for them, in the "Continue" tab.
					By clicking on one fractal, the user is sent to the "New" tab with all the fields completed with the necessary information.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="Download">
				<h3>The <code>Download Page</code></h3>
				<p>
					Whenever a uses may want to share his work, or simply take his work offline, he's given the option to use our "Download" page.
					Here he can choose which fractals to download, in which formats, and whether if he wants to download them all in bulk or one by one.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="Logout">
				<h3>The <code>Logout</code></h3>
				<p>
					When the work is done, there's no reason to hang around. This is the hero's exit.

	<section  typeof="sa:Architecture" id="architecture">
		<h2>Architecture</h2>

		<p>
			Our choice was to make I-Fractr a Single Page Application. Why? There's a plethora of reasons to use a SPA architecture instead of a MPA one - first and foremost,
			the Single Page Application is fast. In fact, it is terribly fast, as most resources (HTML, CSS, Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifetime
			of the application. Only data is transmitted back and forth.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the biggest disadvantages of MPAs is that frontend and backend development are tightly coupled. Thus, the development becomes more complex and
			starts to require more time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since our application is mainly client-side focused and, in theory, should not become a huge app, making it a Single Page Application is a given.
		</p>

	<section typeof="sa:Intermediate Stages" id="intermediate_stages">
		<h2>Intermediate Stages</h2>
		<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing we did after choosing our project was have an intense brainstorming session. We tried to come up with new and innovative ideeas,
			find a balance between what we had to bring to the table and what we wanted to make. Lots of ideeas started here, lots more have been discarded since -
			but everything we did has its roots in this brainstorming session.
		</p>

		<h3>Planning</h3>
		<p>
			After coming up with new and bright ideeas, we had a lot to discuss about the ways we could implement them in our website. It is at this point we realised that
			not everything is as easy as it seems, and as a consequence we had to admit that some features won't make it to the end product. However, we also managed to polish
			what we thought achievable and bring forth our hypothetical version of I-Fractr.
		</p>

		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>
			It is useless to have great things to implement if we can't present them in a beautiful and clear way. That's why we put a lot of effort in our designs - we started
			with a pen and a paper, then we moved to prototyping, and little by little we managed to have our entire design made in Adobe XD, in wireframes. This allowed us to change
			things incredibly fast, without having to touch any code, until we achieved our version of the app. We had to take into consideration color combinations, font combinations,
			color or font qualities, proportions and lots of other design principles.
		</p>
		<h3>L-System fractal management</h3>
		<p>
			Despite having the draw function as the most important part of the app, we needed the input table to generate a valid l-system for our application to use - and as such, a generator that uses the rules specified by the 
			user was developed. THe L-Systems generated here can go up to 100 000 lines.
		</p>
		<h3>The Draw function</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing we wanted to do once we started working on I-Fractr was develop the draw function - the backbone functionality of our web application. Once the draw function is completed, we can start
			implementing more and more features that are using it, such as preview, modify fractal or view our list. 
		</p>
		<h3>Other functionalities</h3>
		<p>
			With the 2 most important features out of the way, it was time for some quality of life changes. We added a sign-up/login, made the continue page functional,
			the download page works as intended. In order to make these work, we used the localStorage feature. We used two arrays of fractals, one for our default list of fractals
			and the other for the user's creations. When the user clicks on one to modify, the proper array is called and the proper fractal is shown on the canvas.
		</p>
		

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			We believe that the main take-away from this journey is that a project phase is never truly finished, you always find little changes you want to make along the way. This happened to us too,
			and we started to go through each phase again and again, until we became content with our work. What we understood during this semester is that as the app evolves, so do we, as developers.

	<section typeof="sa:Data Modelling" id="data_modelling">
		<h2>Data Modelling</h2>

		<p>
			For our app, we implemented a login functionality - which means of course that some credentials are needed. That is why our MySQL database has a table
			dedicated to user credentials (username and password, declared as strings). The download and save functionalities were developed using the Local Storage and 
			not the database, and will be detailed with the following step.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also applied the schema microdata (itemscope, itemtype & itemprop) on our app, so that it becomes easier for search engines to identify its purpose.
			The itemtypes we found to be suitable for our project were ImageObject, Painting, VisualArtwork, WebPage and ImageGallery (and were distributed appropriately throughout the website),
			while the itemscope was to be determined based on the content assigned to it.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section typeof="sa:Client-based Data Storage" id="data_storage">
		<h2>Client-based Data Storage</h2>

		<p>
			We chose to store the fractals themselves on the client-side, by using the local storage. More precisely, we determined two arrays of fractals were needed - one filled by ourselves, 
			the developers, and the other to be filled by the user. Our array, called "defaultFractals", holds all the fractals we wanted displayed in the "List" sections for the user to choose.
			The other one, simply called "fractals", is more dynamic; it gets updated every time the user saves a fractal. Thus, when a fractal is clicked, the app checks to see in which array it 
			should look for it, then takes it and displays it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The download functionality is also implemented using these two arrays; every array is filled with an "Fractal" object, which contains the rules, angles, iterations and, more importantly,
			has an "image" property. Every time a new "Fractal" object is added, we also save the png image in the localStorage - and when the user clicks on Download, the PNG is delivered to him.
		</p>

	<section typeof="sa:Testing" id="testing">
			<h2>Testing</h2>
	
			<p>
				We tested our application thoroughly and, needless to say, have discovered plenty of bugs. We tested every functionality for errors and the design for visual bugs.
				Some more interesting bugs we found were:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The "canvas" broke and became unusable everytime we tried to go over to the "SVG" section</li>
				<li>The font-size on the input-boxes became abysmally small everytime you tried to write something in them; and 
					changing it would update the size of the input box and disrupt the entire layout of the page  </li>
				<li>Clicking on our fractals in the "list" functionality would display the user's fractals instead of the default ones in the canvas, OR clicking 
					in the user's list would display the default fractals instead of the user's. A mess. </li>
				<li>When shrinking the page all the way to mobile, the displayed fractals would become shockingly small.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We went through most of our backlog of bugs and started fixing them one by one, in order to offer a functional website.</p>
	</section>

	<section typeof="sa:Practical use of our website" id="usage">
			<h2>Practial use</h2>
	
			<p>The website's practicality comes from it's easiness to work with and update the PNG.</p>
			
			<p>As expected from a l-system application, the l-system assumes some prior knowledge of the user in regards to the way l-systems work.</p>
			<p>The site offers the main functionality of viewing or playing around with fractals, and saving them after as PNG, to showcase wherever you need. It also
				has a save function, to continue working at a later date, and a list of predefined, beautiful fractals to serve as inspiration.
